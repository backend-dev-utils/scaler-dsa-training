Problem Description

    Given a matrix A of size Nx3 representing operations.
    Your task is to design the linked list based on these operations.

    There are four types of operations:

    0 x -1: Add a node of value x before the first element of the linked list.
            After the insertion, the new node will be the first node of the linked list.

    1 x -1: Append a node of value x to the last element of the linked list.

    2 x index: Add a node of value x before the index-th node in the linked list.
               If the index equals the length of the linked list, the node will be appended
                to the end of the linked list.
               If the index is greater than the length, the node will not be inserted.

    3 index -1: Delete the index-th node in the linked list, if the index is valid.

    A[i][0] represents the type of operation.

    A[i][1], A[i][2] represents the corresponding elements with respect to type of operation.

Note: Indexing is 0 based.

Problem Constraints:
    1 <= Number of operations <= 1000
    1 <= All node values <= 109

Input Format:
    The only argument given is matrix A.

Output Format:
    Return the pointer to the starting of the linked list.

Examples:
    -----------------------------------------
    Input : 1
    A = [ [0, 1, -1], [1, 2, -1], [2, 3, 1] ]

    Output:
    1 -> 3 -> 2 -> NULL

    Hint :
    After first operation the list is 1 -> NULL
    After second operation the list is 1 -> 2 -> NULL
    After third operation the list is 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> NULL

    -----------------------------------------
    Input : 2
    A = [ [0, 1, -1], [1, 2, -1], [2, 3, 1], [0, 4, -1], [3, 1, -1], [3, 2, -1] ]

    Output:
    4 -> 3 -> NULL

    Hint :
    After first operation the list is 1 -> NULL
    After second operation the list is 1 -> 2 -> NULL
    After third operation the list is 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> NULL
    After fourth operation the list is 4 -> 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> NULL
    After fifth operation the list is 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> NULL
    After sixth operation the list is 4 -> 3 -> NULL
